What an epic movie, with some incredible de-aging, a legendary cast, and stellar performances throughout; perhaps the best I've ever seen from Joe Pesci.\n\nI give it 10 for how well it was directed/written/acted/etc.  \n\nI give my enjoyment of it a 7/10.  \n\nBut the Irishman theme song by Robbie Robertson that rolls during the 2nd part of the credits, which is also titled \"Remembrance\", is something else.  I struggle to think of more powerful piece of music for any movie.  I must have listened to it 30 times already.  If you left the movie theater during the credits, go back and give this song some time.  By itself, it's incredible, but when you think of the loyalty and regret and sadness that it conveys, it's even more special.\n",

Going to watch *The Two Towers* later. But seeing LotR for the first time wasn?t as much an adventure as I though it would be. Maybe I should have watched it earlier, when I was still a kid (I?m 24 yo). I mean it was good. But it didn?t feel like a masterpiece. Maybe my expectations were too high. \n\nFavourite of the week: The Martian. Great story, I loved the scenes when MD builds that Mars Farm. I loved the ending because imo &gt;!these kinds of film don?t always have to kill a main character. I was so happy that everyone survived. I didn?t expect that!&lt;\n\nThe whole cast was great, Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Sebastian Stan, that NASA Boss. Great movie. (Sorry, I am not a native speaker and I use *great* too often)\n",

There it is. \n\nROMA is one of the greatest films of the last decade. \n\nIt?s beautiful, heartfelt, comedic and yet truly sad. It follows the story of Alfonso Cuar\ufffdn?s childhood, and the maid who worked at his home, Cleo. \n\nThe direction is unbelievable. The camera moves in simple pans and tracking shots, but the complexity behind the takes creates a sense of awe. You can watch different parts of the frame and see different stories. The sound design comes from every area of the theater, conversations and footsteps sounding like their behind you, adding to the setting. It truly feels like I?m there. \n\nI don?t want to get into the story much because I think it?s something worth experiencing blind, but it?s so personal and so real. It?s a piece of Alfonso?s life that he shared with us, and I?m so glad he did. \n\n\nAlso, the black and white cinematography is to die for. \n\nPlease see it in theaters if you can. It is absolutely worth it. \nSYSTEM: I have no idea why people can't get over the visuals and see this movie for what it is, an overly indulgent, barren waste of time.  There are no characters, there is no plot, there is no tension, there are no stakes, there is no drama.  \n\nGood cinematography is NOT just nice scenery.  There are no interesting shots, framing or angles in this movie, its soooo uncreative and uninteresting.  \n\nYou don' want to go into the story because you could fully describe the entire \"story\" in a single sentence and reveal the entire movie.  \n",

I hope it made enough to ensure a sequel because I would definitely watch it.\nSYSTEM: I've avoided watching because every transformers movie, this one included, is really a humans story featuring transformers. That opening scene which you call a wonderful homage...I want that to be the whole movie. \n\nThere's only one transformers movie, the animated one from 1986. Until they're brave enough to ditch the humans almost entirely I won't bother watching since I know the movie will be about some teenage boy or girl and will just happen to have transformers in it to drive the action scenes. \n\nImagine if the next avengers movie was about some teenager with the avengers just popping up for comic relief or action scenes every now and then? \nSYSTEM: This is an acceptable if a bit extreme stance, but here's my thoughts:\n\nI also would like that Cybertron scene to be a whole movie, but only a special kind of filmmaker would take the formula and make it compelling for everyone not just fans or kids. The reason why the franchise existed and was formulated is because of the need to sell toys. The primary goal was never really to tell compelling stories so even if occasionally they managed to do that, even the most hardcore fan should admit that it's not really a media franchise with narrative depth. Sure they can add stuff but the original setup of characters and plot simply being excuses to hawk toys will always hinder any storyteller. They can't even change it that much or the core fanbase will be alienated. The robots will always be vehicles (heh) for cool action scenes while having juuust enough characterization to justify their existence so the kids buy toys.\n\nSo I don't really mind if the main narrative is about an audience standin because where else can they add depth? Sure you can tell complex stories without them but who aside from Pixar has consistently managed to do that without having human characters as the main focus. Heck, even those Pixar movies have human characters... because it's really hard to make a compelling narrative without a human face to connect to.\n",

So for context, I just watched, ?I Care A Lot?. I was watching it with my girlfriend, who?s grandma is certainly getting to an age where this movie might upset someone. Near the beginning of the movie she was intrigued, but we almost had to shut it off because Marla?s character is a ginormous cunt. We continued to watch after thinking Peter Dinklage and his mob would just take her ass out. That didn?t happen, but I still had a feeling she would die. My girlfriend did not, and became visibly and verbally frustrated when it looked like Marla was going to get out alive. Then boom, the guy from the beginning kills that b and everything is ok. Like a weight was lifted.\n\nIs there another movie where you felt similar to this? Whether they die or not isn?t necessarily the question, just the pure feeling of this character needs to die. More specifically, the main character. I?ve seen the movie, ?Gone Girl,? with Pike in it as well and felt somewhat similar towards her character as well. Seems like she?s just good at playing a bitch. Any suggestions for movies that have characters in it like this? I don?t know why, but it added a dynamic to a movie that I have never experienced before.\n",

I'm not hugely into wrestling (I like the little i've seen and know a few stars but never followed it, even though I'm pretty sure I could become a fan) and I'm usually completely put off by biopics but this is a well acted film with some great humour and tension and a great metal driven soundtrack I wish took centre stage more often. Once or twice a joke didn't quite land or some drama was slightly manufactured but luckily neither happened often. Highly recommended.\nSYSTEM: A friend of mine who *is* a wrestling fan says it was absolutely terrible and turned it off after about an hour. \n\nInteresting. I wonder if there?s something to that.\nSYSTEM: But isn't wrestling all fake anyway? Why would inaccuracies matter if the \"sport\" doesn't take itself seriously in the first place?\nSYSTEM: How dare you say the F word. Wrestling isn?t fake at all; it?s choreographed, not fake. Anything but. \n\n(I never said he didn?t like the inaccuracies. He just said it was shit)\nSYSTEM: Usually when the opinion of a specialist is brought up, it's in relation to inaccuracies. Otherwise their opinion has the same status as anyone else.\n\nThat it's choregraphed is exactly what I mean by fake. If it's all an act, why does it matter if it's being portrayed accurately or not? For example you could switch the winner and the loser, and that would make no difference since the win was never \"real\" in the first place.\nSYSTEM: That?s a bit silly.\nSYSTEM: The obsession over a contest that is actually not really a contest is what is silly.\nSYSTEM: That?s even sillier. Why do you watch movies and tv then? Those aren?t real either you know! But it?s immersive. \n\nYou don?t have to like nor understand why people like wrestling, but don?t say silly things.\nSYSTEM: But movies and tv don't present themselves in a format that gives the pretense they are real.\n\nI understand the appeal of fiction, and I understand the appeal of sports. I don't understand the appeal of mixing the two in a way that renders both meaningless.\nSYSTEM: ...what? They absolutely do. Very few movies and shows break the fourth wall and acknowledge that they're \"fake\". They all pretend they're real so that we can too and get immersed.  \n  \nProfessional wrestling presents itself as real in the same exact way that a stage play presents itself as real.  \n  \nAll the fans know and accept that. It's fun, ridiculous performance art.  \n  \nAnything else is just you not understanding wrestling and repeating a tired, old joke.\nSYSTEM: But it's not the same thing. A movie creates its own independent reality. It's never actually claiming to be real. It makes use of filmic elements to create an experience that is not comparable to reality.\n\nWrestling is made in such a way that, if you didn't know it was fake, you would believe that this is actually a real sport (until you see all the crazy stuff). It's presented as if it was actually happening in the real world, like any other broadcast sport.\n\nI don't understand what is the point of this. Either something is real, or it's not. Blurring the lines in such a way kills the effectiveness as a sport (since there are no real stakes) and also kills the effectiveness as a fiction (since it's not fully designed to be one). By trying to do both it achieves neither.\n\nI can understand that it's fun to watch, but actual sports and actual fiction are so much more than just \"fun\", because they can be taken seriously and they make full use of their potential. Wrestling just seems so inconsequential in comparison.\n\nThat's my take anyway.\n",

Summary Bullet Point\n\n1. As a guy, I struggled at parts so WARNING **THIS MOVIE CONTAINS SEXUAL ABUSE AND SHOULD NOT BE WATCHED ALONE IF ITS A HARD TOPIC FOR YOU**\n2. AMAZING MOVIE\n3. It pulls your heart\n\nCounseling was used during the making of this movie which should tell you something\n\nCounseling was avaiable at the showcasing film festival for the audience\n\nI just watched it and as a guy who feels can handle alot of the movie brutality damn this movie was hard at certain points. In the first 15 minutes I had to pause becuase the movie dosent give a fuck and its just raw brutal. The movie has some mixed reviews and I think its due to the sexual abuse. There are for sure 3 scenes with it maybe 4. We start with Clare an irish convict sent to Australia where she faces many challenges as do the native population. Im not good at explaining but if you look up reviews for it some will say its bad because it has r\\*pe others because the movie dosent see colonialism as something that happened and good came out of it sees it as brutal and evil. Well to that just look up what happened to the native population (Aboriginal Tasmanians were almost driven to extinction). At the end of the day its BRILLIANT filmmaking and a great movie.\n\nEdit: It's available on Hulu (US) and will be released on Blu-ray Feb. 4th so good timing for this post lol also added picture for refrence\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u09mt5wq0me41.jpg?width=350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27106445b9d9d505bedad3d1e0ddc00c47b78c49\nSYSTEM: This movie is absolutely awful. Goes way too far in its explicit scene and meanders the rest of the movie with mind numbing pacing. My personal worst of the year\nSYSTEM: I agree. I'm not sure why people are praising it. \n\nIt almost glorified the rape scenes by making them go on so long and be so frequent. They never quite hit the horror aspect hard enough in any of them, either, say, compared to I Spit On Your Grave (the original, haven't seen the remake). It felt a bit, overdone, for some reason and without any artistic flair. It felt like a story that didnt need to be told in a way I'd rather avoid. Compared to The Babadook, which told a simple story through horror themes, this was too straight forward in its attempt to be controversial. \n\nThere's a great miniseries from the 70s called Against The Wind that dealt with the colonial / convict stuff this film tries to sneak in significantly better, and is also pretty historically accurate. \n\nThis film is pretty much a rape/revenge fantasy set in colonial times for no reason. I felt like it should have been a 90 minute film, tops.\n\nAnyway, I didn't plan on thinking too hard on this film. I kinda forgot about it until I saw this thread and am writing my thoughts as I think of them. Which sucks, but, so does the film, so, whatever ,right?\n",

I?m quite sensitive to horror movies, so I?m more looking for more spooky or even suspenseful movies. I just watched Hocus Pocus and I can?t find similar movies online somehow (may also be due to my location). I?m also looking for a good keyword to search in Netflix.\nSYSTEM: The Adam?s Family, The Witches, Evil Dead, Ash vs Evil Dead, Underworld, would be my suggestions, and they?re all on  Netflix?\nUSER: I remember watching the Witches when I was a kid and it scared me quite a bit, will see how I feel about it now and Addam?s family is one of my favorite movies (no. 2 even more). Will have a look at the other ones as well. Thanks.\n",

Hi, I am interested in finding extremely taboo, industry pushing- the type that makes most people extremely offended. I want to expand my horizons.  Im not really talking about 12 years a slave, midsummer... im assuming you get the gist. Im talking about something like KIDS (which is not to taboo currently but at that time), antichrist (haven't watched, but I heard people absolutely hated it), Lolita, and cuties (From what I was understand, haven't watched it but the whole purpose of the movie was to show some type of reality in a thoughtful way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it helps I want to give a background of me, I was born 2003, as a gen z who grew up right when the iPhones started booming- there is just so much information.  As if \"we know everything, what is wrong and what is right\". I want to explore. And I want to be free- and will not be contempt unless I see a whole another side whatever that may be. Despite the issue. I feel like somethings being hidden from me (and not conspiracy) but more of there being so much information to the point you will not be able to dig from a different perspectives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I want to wacth a movie and feel: How dare you? Basically as some type of personal attack. I don't want to be in my little bubble anymore and I want to be able to think more independently so I can navigate controversies and expand my horizons.
